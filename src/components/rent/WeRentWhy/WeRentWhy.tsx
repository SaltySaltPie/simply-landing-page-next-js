            with many <b>waiting up to seven years just to access Section 8</b> housing assistance. Right now, for every
            three extremely low-income families, two are unable to secure a rental home due to the severe shortage of
            affordable options, particularly in rapidly growing metropolitan areas (MSAs), where economic mobility is
            increasingly out of reach for many.

            <b>The challenge of affordable housing is not just an affordability crisis but also an identity crisis.</b>{" "}
            When families are unable to find stable, affordable homes, it disrupts the very fabric of the neighborhoods
            they wish to be part of. Communities thrive when their members have secure places to live, preserving
            experiences, fostering connections, and sharing a sense of belonging. But when affordable housing is out of
            reach, it fractures this identity, leading to transience and instability that weaken the bonds that make a
            community strong.
