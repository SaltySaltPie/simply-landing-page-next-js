            When families are unable to find stable, affordable homes, it disrupts the very fabric of the neighborhoods
            they wish to be part of. Communities thrive when their members have secure places to live, preserving
            experiences, fostering connections, and sharing a sense of belonging. But when affordable housing is out of
            reach, it fractures this identity, leading to transience and instability that weaken the bonds that make a
            community strong.
